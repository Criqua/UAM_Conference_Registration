# UAM Conference Registration

Practice developed as part of the **1st Evaluation Period** for the **Web Design & E-Commerce** course. It consists of the creation of a conference registration website, which includes general information about **Universidad Americana (UAM)**, its mission, vision, and a brief overview. Additionally, the site lists several tech events based on specific topics and allows users to fill out a registration form by entering personal information and selecting which conferences they want to attend.

The content is organized into semantically structured sections, with a modern and responsive design. Basic validations are implemented in the registration form using **JavaScript** to ensure that the submitted data fulfills the required criteria before simulating its submission.
